# Introduction

So...why a book?  We have a very well written documentation section.  We also have a nice blog.  A book is just so...old school.  We wanted to write a book because it is very easy to get lost in all the documentation, examples, and videos.  We wanted to put something together that when you're done reading it you will have a fully configured Octopus Deploy server ready to scale with your company.

Everyone who works at Octopus Deploy likes to think our product is super easy to use and is very easy to set up.  In talking with our customers we have found that to be partially true.  Octopus Deploy is a complex product.  It offers a lot of functionality.  It was designed to help reinforce best deployment practices such as building artifacts once, using the same deployment process for each environment, or restricting access to production machines to name a few.  While at the same time offering users such as yourself the flexibility so Octopus Deploy can meet your companies needs.  But that flexibility is a double-edged sword.  

All the authors of this book are solution architects at Octopus Deploy focused on customer success.  We meet with customers often to discuss what is working for them, what isnâ€™t working for them and offer recommendations.  We have seen...some interesting configurations with Octopus Deploy.  In some cases, bad practices have been going on for so long that changing them takes quite a bit of effort.  That is what drove us to write this book.  We wanted to take all those lessons we have learned and share them with the community.  This way we can help them help themselves.

Anytime you start learning something new you go through a series of steps.  First you start out learning the basics.  This is where you get immersed in the nomenclature of the product and learn how it works.  Typically a proof of concept is created to see if it works for your basic needs.  After that you move onto a pilot project or a pilot group.  This is where you try to adopt in your day to day life.  Any short-cuts made during the proof of concept phase is removed and it slowly morphs into a working solution.  After that comes adoption, where everyone in the company starts using it.  This is where a bad configuration or two becomes a standard.  And if that bad configuration is allowed to stay a standard then changing it starts to take more and more time.  It goes from one week, to one month, to a year-long project.  

Our UI team is always improving the onboarding process.  Our documentation has a great getting started guide.  But those are targeted at people who are just starting with Octopus Deploy and might be working on a proof of concept.  Rather than worry about that, the intended audience for this book are people who are in the middle of a pilot project using Octopus Deploy or are about to start expanding to the rest of the company.  Our goal of this book is to help you make better decisions on your configuration so Octopus Deploy can scale with your company.  That is not to say experts in Octopus Deploy won't gain anything from it.  

In this book we are going to take a fresh install of Octopus Deploy and configure it to scale.  We are going to start at the very start, setting up your infrastructure and proceed on with configuring environments, lifecycles, retention policies, projects, security, performance, and maintainability.  It is designed to be read from cover to cover or you can pick your favorite topic out and jump right to it.  We have a number of projects which we will be using in this book.  Some of them are applications which are deployed to a few IIS machines on-premise.  We have other applications which are multi-tenant.  And we have others which cover multiple data centers.  We aren't so full of ourselves to believe what we recommend will solve every possible scenario you run into in your day to day life.  Our goal is to provide you with recommendations which you can then adjust to meet your needs.

Finally, this book does have a lot of overlap with our getting started guide in the UI as well as our on-boarding process.  With that said, we are going to assume you have some familiarity with Octopus Deploy.  We assume you know what a tentacle is and you know how to add steps into your deployment process.  If none of those terms are familiar to you or if this is your first time using Octopus Deploy we recommend you read our getting started guide and create a Proof of Concept using our onboarding process.
